# Data Cleaning & Exploratory Data Analysis using Python

# Hey! I'm Kishan Gupta

This project focuses on cleaning and analyzing a real-world dataset using Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.  
I transformed messy data into a structured format and performed detailed visual exploration to draw meaningful insights.
